"""
get the marginal posterior distributions from your result
function [marginal,x,weight]=marginalize(result,dimension)
this function gets the marginal distribution for result
It returns 3 variables:

  marginal - the values of the marginal posterior
  x        - the gridpoints at which the posterior is sampled
  weight   - the integration weight for this point

This also works for more than one dimension in dimension to obtain
multidimensional marginals, x then becomes a cell array of the 1D ticks
of the grid.
