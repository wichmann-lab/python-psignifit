# now we can have a look at the res dictionary and all its fields

# list of result fields
# ---------------------
#
# Here we list all fields of the result dictionary in the format
#
#     res['fieldname']        = short description
#
# after it follow some explanation and allowed values
#
#     res['Fit'] = the fitted parameter of the psychometric function
#
# Which kind of fit was performed is determined by the options you set.
# It might be mean, median or MAP.; The order of reported parameters is;[threshold,width,lambda,gamma,eta]
#
#     res['conf_Intervals'] = confidence intervals for the fit
#
# the confidence intervals for the 5 parameters.The order of reported parameters is[threshold,width,lambda,gamma,eta]
#
#     res['data'] = data used for the fit
#
# the array used as data input for psignifit
#
#     res['options'] = the options used for the fit
#
# contains all options set for the fit including automatically set values
#
#     res['timestamp'] = When the data result was created
#     res['Posterior'] = posterior density at the gridpoints
#     normalized Posterior density evaluated at the final gridpoints
#     res['weight'] = integration weight for each gridpoint
#
# this is the volume of parameter space each gridpoint "speaks for". This
# is needed for integrations over the space.
#
#     res['X1D'] = positions of the gridpoints on the 5 dimensions a cell array of vectors
#     res['marginals']   = marginal densities for the 5 parameters
#     res['marginalsX']  = positions of the marginal evaluations
#     res['marginalsW']  = integration weight for each gridpoint
#
# Used together these three represent the marginal posterior distributions'
#
#     res['logPmax'], res['integral'] = normalization constants
#
# the maximal log-likelihood which is subtracted prior to computing the
# exponential to avoid numerical problems
# and the integral over the likelihood accross the parameter space, used
# for normalizing into a probability.
