DEMO_005 PLOTTING FUNCTIONS
===========================

 Here the basic plot functions which come with the toolbox are explained.
 Most of the functions return the handle of the axis they plotted in
 to enable you to plot further details and change axis properties after the plot.

 To have something to plot we use the example data as provided in demo_001

# plotPsych
# ---------
#
# This funciton plots the fitted psychometric function with the measured data.
#  It takes the result dict you want to plot. You can also set plotting options.

# plotMarginal
# ------------
#
# This function plots the marginal posterior density for a single parameter.
# As input it requires a results dictionary, the parameter to plot and optionally
# plotting options and a handle to an axis to plot in.
# (As usual 1 = threshold, 2 = width, 3 = lambda, 4 = gamma, 5 = eta)

# The gray shadow corresponds to the chosen confidence interval and the black
# line shows the point estimate for the plotted parameter.

#  respective default values assigned to change the behaviour of the plot:
# 'dim' = 0

# plot2D
# ------
#
# This plots 2 dimensional posterior marginals.
# As input this function expects the result dict, two numbers for the two parameters
# to plot against each other and optionally a handle h to the axis to plot in
# and plotting options.

# 'label2'    = '[parameter name]'   # label for the second parameter

# %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
# plotPrior
# ---------
# As a tool this function plots the actually used priors of the provided
# result dictionary.
