# SAVE DATA IN RIGHT FORMAT
# -------------------------
#
# First we need the data in the format (x | nCorrect | total)
# As an example we use the following dataset from a 2AFC experiment with 90
# trials at each stimulus level. This dataset comes from a simple signal
# detection experiment.

data = np.array([[0.0010, 45.0000, 90.0000], [0.0015, 50.0000, 90.0000],
                 [0.0020, 44.0000, 90.0000], [0.0025, 44.0000, 90.0000],
                 [0.0030, 52.0000, 90.0000], [0.0035, 53.0000, 90.0000],
                 [0.0040, 62.0000, 90.0000], [0.0045, 64.0000, 90.0000],
                 [0.0050, 76.0000, 90.0000], [0.0060, 79.0000, 90.0000],
                 [0.0070, 88.0000, 90.0000], [0.0080, 90.0000, 90.0000],
                 [0.0100, 90.0000, 90.0000]])


# %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
# SAVE DATA IN RIGHT FORMAT
# remark: This format differs slightly from the format used in older
# psignifit versions. You can convert your data by using the reformat
# comand. If you are a user of the older psignifits.
#
#
# CONSTRUCT THE OPTIONS DICTONARY
# -------------------------------
#
# To start psignifit you need to pass a dictionary, which specifies, what kind
# of experiment you did and any other parameters of the fit you might want
#
#
# You can create an empty dictionary by simply calling <name> = dict()

options = dict()  # initialize as an empty dict

# %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
# Now you can set the different options with lines of the form
# <name>['<key>'] as in the following lines:

options['sigmoidName'] = 'norm'  # choose a cumulative Gauss as the sigmoid
options.experiment_type = '2AFC'  # choose 2-AFC as the paradigm of the experiment
# this sets the guessing rate to .5 and
# fits the rest of the parameters '''

# %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
#  There are 3 other types of experiments supported out of the box:
#
#  n alternative forces choice: The guessing rate is known.
#        options.experiment_type = ExperimentType.N_AFC
#        options.experiment_choices    = <number of alternatives>
#  Yes/No experiments: A free guessing and lapse rate is estimated
#        options.experiment_type = ExperimentType.YES_NO
#  equal asymptote: As Yes/No, but enforces that guessing and lapsing occure equally often
#        options.experiment_type = ExperimentType.EQ_ASYMPTOTE
#
#  Out of the box psignifit supports the following sigmoid functions,
#  choosen by:
#  options.sigmoidName = ...
#
#  'norm'        a cummulative gauss distribution
#  'logistic'    a logistic function
#  'gumbel'      a cummulative gumbel distribution
#  'rgumbel'     a reversed gumbel distribution
#  'tdist'       a t-distribution with df=1 as a heavytail distribution
#
#  for positive stimulus levels which make sence on a log-scale:
#
#  'logn'        a cumulative lognormal distribution
#  'Weibull'     a Weibull function
#
#  There are many other options you can set in the options-file. You find
#  them in demo_002
#
#
# NOW RUN PSIGNIFIT
# -----------------
#
#  Now we are ready to run the main function, which fits the function to the
#  data. You obtain a struct, which contains all the information about the
#  fitted function and can be passed to the many other functions in this
#  toolbox, to further process the results.

res = ps.psignifit(data, options)

# %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
# VISUALIZE THE RESULTS
# ---------------------
#
# For example you can use the result dict res to plot your psychometric
# function with the data:

ps.psigniplot.plotPsych(res)

plt.show()

# %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
# REMARK FOR INSUFFICIENT MEMORY ISSUES
# -------------------------------------
#
# Especially for YesNo experiments the result structs can become rather
# large. If you run into memory issues you can drop the Posterior from the
# result with the following command.

del res['Posterior']
del res['weight']

# %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
# Without these fields you will not be able to use the 2D Bayesian plots
# anymore and the equalityTest will fail. All other functions work without
# it.
